## What i learned

### Module organization practice

### Life cycle hooks

`ngAfterViewInit()`

When the application loads, the child element may not be loaded completely, and if we try to access the component, it returns undefined. To resolve this, we use the lifecycle hook, which allows us to access any element after the view is initialized.

### DOM manipulation

`@ViewChild` and `@ViewChildren` are the types of decorators used to **query the DOM element of a child component**.

See: [Querying the DOM with @ViewChild and @ViewChildren](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/querying-the-dom-with-@viewchild-and-@viewchildren)

### Tabindex

`tabindex` attribute indicates that its element can be focused.

Make a button that is NOT accessible when pressing the tabulation :

```
<button
  role="tab"
  [attr.aria-controls]="'panel-' + panelId"
  [attr.aria-selected]="isSelected"
  [attr.tabindex]="-1"
>
  <ng-content></ng-content>
</button>
```
